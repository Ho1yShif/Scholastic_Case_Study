# Case Study Repository

This repository supports my analysis of a Data Science case study for the 2022 Scholastic Super Day as part of the interview process for Associate Data Scientists.

These notebooks detail my processes for Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, and Modeling.

As per Scholastic's request, no confidential case study data will be included in this repository,Â just my own work.
